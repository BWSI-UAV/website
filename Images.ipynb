    "### Digital Image Representation and Color Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can get to manipulating images, we first need a way to represent images in Python. In this lab will, we will represent a digital image as a two-dimensional array, where each element of the array corresponds to a pixel in the image. \n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, we will narrow our focus to grayscale images. In a gayscale image, each pixel is represented by a single integer in the range `[0,255]` (1 byte can contain 256 different values). These integers correspond to the intensity of light present at each pixel, with 0 being completely black and 255 being completely white.\n",

    "In this lab, we will represent images as numpy arrays. For example, consider the 2 x 3 image:\n",
