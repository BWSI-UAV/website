    "## Connecting to the drone with VSCode\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install VSCode onto your computer (not the drone), [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Open a terminal window on your computer and run:\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd ~/.ssh\n",
    "ls\n",
    "```\n",
    "- If you do not see `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub`, enter this command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C \"your_email@example.com\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "*Do not enter a filepath, username, or password, just press `return` when asked for those fields*\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Enter `cat id_rsa.pub` and copy the whole ssh key that is printed to your terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Open a terminal window that is SSH'd into your drone:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    cd ~/.ssh\n",
    "    ls\n",
    "    vim authorized_keys\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    + Navigate the bottom of the file, press `i` to enter `insert` mode, and paste your id_rsa.pub key. Then save and quit (press `esc`, then `:wq`)\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. In your computer's terminal (in the ~/.ssh folder) type:\n",
    "```\n",
    "vim config\n",
    "```\n",
    "Add the following block (4 spaces, not tabs):\n",
    "```\n",
    "Host <teamname>\n",
    "    User uav\n",
    "    HostName <teamname>.beaver.works\n",
    "    ForwardX11 yes\n",
    "    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Try SSH'ing into the drone in a new terminal. You should be able to use simply `ssh <teamname>`. You also should not have to enter the drone password anymore\n",
    "\n",
    "6. If this works, go to VSCode:\n",
    "    + Click the square icon in the sidebar under the debug icon\n",
    "    + Search for SSH and install the \"Remote-SSH\" plugin made by Microsoft\n",
    "    + Select the monitor icon that appears in the sidebar, then click the window icon that appears when you hovor over your teamname option under `Connections`"
