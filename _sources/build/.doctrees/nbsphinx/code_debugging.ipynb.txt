    "As a short practical exercise in code debugging, we present a virtual environment containing four bugged versions of winged drone simulation.\n",

    "This challenged is adapted from an interview question given by [Zipline](https://flyzipline.com/) to be completed for their Robotics Engineering Internship / Co-op (Summer or Fall 2021).\n",

    "In compliance with the license requirements this code was modified for educational purposes and used with permission.\n",

    "## Running the code\n",
    "\n",
    "Clone the following Git repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/BWSI-UAV/bugged_zip_sims_repo.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Prepare your local environment to run Pygame window:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install -U pygame --user\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Code can be run by invoking `python bugged_zip_sim_<<NUM>>.py`. Each simulation contains at least 1 error which causes unintended behavior. The errors are progressively more difficult to find and correct. *Note bugs will not necessarily result in a stack trace error.* Use your python debugging skills to figure out what is causing the deviations from expected behavior."
