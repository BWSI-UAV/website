    "\n",
    "The fundamental tool of every programmer is there text editor. While there many options for text editors, they generally fall into two categories: terminal-based and GUI-based.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the name implies, GUI-based text editors open up their own graphical user interface for you two write in. It is likely you have all worked with a GUI-based text editor such as Notepad, Notepad++, Visual Studio, Eclipse, MATLAB's editor, gedit, or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) (my personal favorite)\n",
    "\n",
    "Terminal-based editors run directly in a command terminal and do not open up a separate window/interface. These can be a bit more tedious to work with at first. For example, you often can't use your mouse to move your cursor to different part of a file. It can even be hard to figure our how to exit a terminal-based text editor once it's started!!\n",
    "\n",
    "In spite of these initial difficulties, terminal-based text editors are very important for robotics and embedded programming. When modifying code on another \"remote\" computer or onboard your drone, you often can't open a graphical interface. This means you __must use a terminal-based editor__."
