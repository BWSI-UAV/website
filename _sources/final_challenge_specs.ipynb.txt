    "# Final Challenge Specs: Vertical Slalom\n",
    "A full circuit will be illuminated with LEDs. On both sides there will be a series of hurdles which the robot must go over and under.\n",
    "The hurdles will have AR tags taped to thier front. Odd # AR tags will indicate a hurdle that must be flown over, and even # AR tags correspond to hurdles to fly under.\n",
    "Completion requires traveling 3 loops without crashing or interference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rankings will be ordered by the fastest $ time $ out of 3 runs. The team with the lowest time wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grazing the obstacles, flying around them the wrong way, and interfering with the flight will result in a failed run.\n",
    "\n",
    "## LED Track Dimensions:\n",
    "Shaped like a track field, with stright segments being 18ft long and curved sections being a half-circle with a diameter of 8ft.\n",
    "Total length is about 10 meters.\n",

    "## Procedure\n",
    "Upon arriving, students should immediatly start preparing for flight. The first team should be ready to fly by 9:20.\n",
    "\n",
    "There will be 2 heats of flights, one at [9:20 - 10:40] and the other at [10:40 - 12:00]. In each heat, every team will get an 18 minute time slot to fly the challenge(s).\n",
    "The order in which the teams fly will be randomized. (same order for both heats)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Next team up should be ready to arm and fly their drone before they are called to the control station. This means all necessary nodes are allready running.\n",
    "2. When called to the control station, team will have exactly 16 minutes to perform flights.\n",
    "3. The team at the control station is responsible for following all saftey regulations as outlined [HERE](https://bwsi-uav.github.io/website/safety_checklist.html?highlight=safety)\n"
