    "## Unit 1 - Connection and Position Control\n",
    "\n",
    "In this unit you will write code to connect to, receive telemetry from, and send commands to your Tello drone to allow you to fly in position control. \n",
    "\n",
    "Challenges include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Connect to your drone\n",
    "\n",
    "* Display drone telemetry\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fly your drone in position control\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fly around objects in your house \n",
    "\n",
    "If you get stuck, refer to the resources page and reach out to other students and your instructors for help!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connect to Drone\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a simple script in your IDE of choice to initialize your Tello, connect to it over Wi-Fi, and display some basic information about the drone (e.g. battery percentage) to confirm that you have successfully connected. \n",
    "When done, take a screenshot of your python output where you printed your drone information and show it to your instructors. You may run into seem errors establishing a socket connection through the SDK. Make sure you read the documentation FAQs before asking for help.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Take Off and Hover\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a script to connect to your Tello the same way you did in the previous challenge, but now, have the drone takeoff, hover for a certain period of time (e.g. 3 seconds), then land. \n",
    "Hint: use the `sleep()` function from the `time` package to have the drone hover before it lands. \n",
    "When done, take a picture of your Tello with your phone while it’s hovering.\n",

    "### Controlled Flight\n",
    "\n",

    "In this unit you will write code that allows you to stream video being taken by your Tello camera drone via python’s open source computer vision library (Open CV). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Detect ArUco Markers\n",
    "Write a simple script in your IDE of choice to stream video from your Tello’s camera and display via OpenCV.\n",
    "Hint: Don’t forget to use the `streamon()` and `get_frame_read()` functions from the `djitellopy` package!\n",

    "\n",
    "Now use the aruco module from the opencv-contrib-python package to detect aruco markers from your Tello’s live camera feed. The goal is to detect ID numbers and be able to return the pixel locations of the four corners of the aruco markers that appear in your video stream.\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why do we use ArUco Tags?\n",
    "\n",
    "AR tags, or more specifically, aruco markers are helpful features that we can utilize when attempting autonomous flight because they are easily recognizable by computer vision algorithms that we write, can convey information based on their ID numbers, and can tell us about our drone’s relative distance and orientation from the markers \n",
    "\n",
    "When flying autonomously, your drone will need to know it’s relative distance and orientation to the aruco marker that it detects. To know this information, you will need to extract properties of the aruco marker that that are not given to you by default by the function used in the previous section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding Center of Tags\n",
    "\n",
    "Since you are given corners, you can create a function that finds the average side length of the aruco marker and another that sets a target for the drone to follow at the center (centroid) of the aruco marker. \n",
    "Write a python class called Marker with a constructor that takes in the ID and the four corner values of the aruco marker. When the constructor is called to create an object, call functions (that you will write as well) to calculate the marker’s average side length and centroid and store these values as object attributes that can be referenced when scanning markers in your autonomous flight scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calculating Distance and Orientation\n",
    "Now we have information about how far our drone is from the aruco marker.\n",
    "(average slide length, more pixels = closer, less pixels = farther)\n",
    "We also know which direction the drone is pointing relative to the marker based on the location of the centroid to the middle of the video stream output (a little to the left, a little above, etc.).\n",
    "This is great information, but how do we know where exactly our drone is relative to the marker?\n",
    "\n",
    "This requires us to look at the shape of the marker.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Brainstorm a method for determining orientation and position relative to the markers.__\n",
    "\n",
    "Create another attribute in the Marker class that gives an indication of orientation and position relative to the markers.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This has to do with the camera’s perceived shape of the marker. You may also need to write one or more helper functions in the Marker class for determining this value. \n",
    "When done, write an explanation of what you came up with and provide supporting images/videos. \n",
