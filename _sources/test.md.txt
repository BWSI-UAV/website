You can build nested itemized or enumerated lists:

* One
    - Sublist
        - This
  - Sublist
        - That
        - The other thing
* Two
  - Sublist

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** Whenever you start up the drone you need to boot Aero Compute into Advanced options for Ubuntu (which is set as the default), NOT normal ubuntu. Booting into normal Ubuntu can cause connection problems like QGroundControl not being able to connect with the drone (e.g. 'Error on socket: Connection refused')
