    "## Bonus Challenge 1: Orbiting\n",
    "Full LED loop on, robot must complete a lap while keeping a bright colored object inside its camera view.\n",
    "Bright object will be on a vertical stick.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rankings will be ordered by the lowest $ time $ out of 3 runs. The team with the lowest time wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Letting the object leave the camera's FOV or intervening with the flight will result in a failed run.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bonus Challenge 2: Precision Placement\n",
    "Robot has object tied to its bottom via string, goal is to place object in a small target area (10x10cm)\n",
    "String must be at least 6\" and can be tied to any safe location on the drone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rankings will be ordered by the lowest $ time $ out of 3 runs. The team with the lowest time wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intervening with the flight will result in a failed run.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bonus Challenge 3: Object Recognition\n",
    "A mapping between a set of objects and an AR tag number will be given, a opaque wall will obscure the other side of the loop.\n",
    "With the full LED loop on, fly to the other side of the wall, detect the object there,\n",
    "fly back, and land infront of a corresponding AR tag on the near side.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rankings will be ordered by the lowest $ time $ out of 2 runs. The team with the lowest time wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intervening with the flight or landing in front of the wrong object will result in a failed run.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bonus Challenge 4: Buoy observation\n",
    "Perform one loop around the LED track in under 30 seconds.\n",
    "3 vertical sticks with bright tape at the top will be placed inside the loop.\n",
    "The bouys will be spaced evenly while staying collinear.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ score = \\frac{time_a + time_b + time_c}{time} $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ time_a, \\space time_b, \\space time_c $: total time spent with buoy a, b, or c in view\n",
    "\n",
    "$ time $: total time spent completing loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Rankings are ordered by score in descending order."
