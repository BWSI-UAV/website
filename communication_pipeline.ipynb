    "\n",
    "The MAVLink protocol is low-level, which makes it powerful and extensible, but also complicated to use. To simplify our lives, we will make use of [MAVROS](https://github.com/mavlink/mavros/blob/ros2/mavros/README.md). MAVROS can be thought of as a \"wrapper\" for MAVLink that simplifies the communication with ROS.\n",

    "For ROS 2, most of the communication can be done via [microXRCE-DDS](https://github.com/eProsima/Micro-XRCE-DDS), if the controller supports it. It integrates seamlessly with the DDS-based communication system in ROS 2, allowing small devices like microcontrollers to participate in ROS 2 networks.\n",

To this end we have included a partial launch file in `aero_control/communication_pipeline/launch/mavros.launch`.
