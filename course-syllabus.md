## DJI Tello & Passport Curriculum

The UAV course staff have modified the Intel Aero Course content previously used for in person instruction for with the [DJI Tello](https://www.ryzerobotics.com/tello) mini-drone. The drone has core robotic functionality such as an IMU, onboard camera, and Python SDK. There is also an active community of users providing support for the platform. While an economic replacement, it does not offer all the same sensory capabilities.

To manage remote learning, practicals here are called passports. Each student upon receiving a drone is issued a passport, which contains incremental exercises for development of robotic disciplines: controls, machine vision, etc. Instructors or teaching assistants sign off on exercises as they are completed.

## Week 1: Quadcopter Basics (7/11)

**Goal:** We will learn about drones and examples of cutting edge UAV research, review BASH and Version Control using Git, and understand the architecture of drones that will culminate in our first challenge of the program.

- **Monday:** BWSI Kickoff

- **Tuesday:** Introduction & Setup, Intro to Unix, Git, & Debugging

- **Wednesday:** Hardware, Review of ROS

- **Thursday:** Embedded Architecture

- **Friday:** Localization & Reference Frames, Challenge 1

## Week 2: Computer Vision & Machine Learning (ML) (7/18)

**Goal:** We will review Linear Algebra concepts, learn about tools that enable autonomous agents to understand their surroundings using RGB images, and grasp how convolutional neural networks work.

- **Monday:** Intro to Theory, Deriv + Convolution

- **Tuesday:** Linear Transformations, Euler Angles & Quaternions, Equations of Motion

- **Wednesday:** OpenCV, Regression/LED, Equations of Motion Cont

- **Thursday:** Color Segmentation, Integrating with Quadcopter

- **Friday:** Advanced ML Topics in Computer Vision, Intro to Neural Networks, Intro to Tello

## Week 3: Planning and Control (7/25)

**Goal:** We will understand how autonomous systems make decision and execute tasks with precision.

- **Monday:** Programming with Tello, Neural Networks, Estimators

- **Tuesday:** Feedback Control, State Estimation

- **Wednesday:** Planning Concepts

- **Thursday:** Practicals

- **Friday:** Practicals & Intro to Final Challenge

## Week 4: Final Project (8/1)

**Goal:** We will spend the whole week working on the Final Projects in teams.

Since a standardized UAV cage is not readily available in every student’s home, we encourage summer students to choose an open-ended project that encompasses the skills they have learned in the prep coursework and over the summer. In past years, some students built their own race course out of pool noodles and others applied more advanced machine learning topics to create a persona videography drone. If you need project ideas, don’t feel shy about asking the instructors!
