    "## Convert P controller errors to meters\n",
    "In the basic line follower written in this class we perform linear regression on the line and calculate an extension to the line to place a target point in front of the drone. We then feed that point into a P controller designed to make the drone fly to that (continually-shifting) point.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, all of the error calculations are done in pixel space, while the output velocities are in meters per second. Since the downward camera's field of view increases as the drone's altitude increases, this means that for the drone to have the same error in pixel space (and cause the same P controller response) at a low altitude and a high one requires a much bigger error in meters at the high altitude. This means that the P controller will be much more aggressive at low altitudes than at high ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "This could be prevented by using the drone's altitude to convert all the P gains to meters (or any other altitude-invariant unit)."

    "## Use a polynomial regression instead of a linear regression\n",
    "Ideally, when we set the target point we pass to our P controller, we would like to go to the furthest point possible on the line itself. Our current method of doing so treats the line as a mathematical line, finds the centerpoint, and then extends from the centerpoint in the directon of the line a set number of pixels. This works well enough for straight lines, but on curved lines, this encounters problems:\n"
