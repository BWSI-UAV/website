    "```\n",

    "Next you need to make sure that `talker.py` and `listener.py` are _executable_ in order for the launch file to properly access them. This can be done as follows:\n",

    "```\n",
    "cd ~/bwsi-uav/catkin_ws/src/aero_control/communication_pipeline/src/\n",
    "chmod +x talker.py\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you are almost ready to run the launch file that starts `roscore`, `talker.py`, and `listener.py` simultaneously. We've given you part of the launch file in `aero_control/communication_pipeline/launch/talk_listen.launch`, but it's incomplete. Can you figure out what is missing and add it yourself?\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've filled in the missing part of the launch file, follow these steps to run it\n",

    "```\n",

    "1. What needed to be added the launch file?\n",
    "2. Why do we need to run the command `source devel/setup.bash` before running `roslaunch`?\n",
