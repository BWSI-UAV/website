    "1. What rosnodes are running?\n",

    "3. Some of the topics that `mavros` subscribes and publishes to have similar sounding names because they serve related, but distinct, purpose. For example, can you guess what is the functional difference between Publication: `/mavros/local_position/velocity` and Subscription `/mavros/setpoint_velocity/cmd_vel_unstamped`?\n",
    "4. Inspect the messages being sent on the topic `mavros/extended_state`. Roughly how often do you get a new message? Do you think these messages originate from the Aero Compute Board or the AeroFC?"

    "4. As with the previous section, it is cumbersome to run each command in a separate terminal. To this end we have included a partial launch file in `aero_control/communication_pipeline/launch/mavros.launch`. Can you complete the launch file and run it in order to kick off mavros, dispatcher, and command_generator simultaneously?\n",
