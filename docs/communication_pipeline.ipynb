    "We are going to put some of basic tools of ROS into practice on the Intel RTF Drone. We are going to start by creating and sending a simple message in one ROS node (i.e. talker) and receiving it in another. This portion relates to [this ROS tutorial](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/WritingPublisherSubscriber%28python%29), but adapted to our needs.\n",
