    "# Custom ROS Message for Line Params\n",
    "All of the following instructions are based on [this](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingMsgAndSrv#Creating_a_msg) guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "First create the message file using the following commands:\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd ~/bwsi-uav/catkin_ws/src/aero_control\n",
    "mkdir msg\n",
    "touch msg/Line.msg\n",
    "gedit msg/Line.msg\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the message file, add:\n",
    "```\n",
    "float64 x\n",
    "float64 y\n",
    "float64 vx\n",
    "float64 vy\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will enable us to transmit a `P = <x, y> + t * <vx, vy>` line parameterization. (`t` can be any real number and `P` is a point on the line)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each line has the sub-message type followed by the name of the variable.\n",

    "## Building the message with catkin\n",
    "We need to make sure that the msg files are turned into source code for C++, Python, and other languages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Open `aero_control/package.xml`, and make sure these two lines are in it and uncommented:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<build_depend>message_generation</build_depend>\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Open `aero_control/CMakeLists.txt` in your favorite text editor (rosed from the previous tutorial is a good option).\n",
    "\n",
    "Add the message_generation dependency to the find_package call which already exists in your CMakeLists.txt so that you can generate messages. You can do this by simply adding message_generation to the list of COMPONENTS such that it looks like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Do not just add this to your CMakeLists.txt, modify the existing text to add message_generation before the closing parenthesis\n",

    "   std_msgs\n",

    "#   Message1.msg\n",
    "#   Message2.msg\n",
    "# )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Uncomment it by removing the # symbols and then replace the stand in Message*.msg files with your .msg file, such that it looks like this:\n",

    "add_message_files(\n",
    "  FILES\n",
    "  Line.msg\n",

    "#   std_msgs\n",
