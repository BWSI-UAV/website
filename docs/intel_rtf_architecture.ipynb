    "Please answer the following questions based on the videos. For true/false question, if the statement is false, provide a description of why it is false.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are some of the difference between the Intel Aero Drone (i.e. a research and development drone) vs other \"commercial\" or \"toy\" drones?\n",
    "- What are some current applications of autonomous drones? Can you think of any future applications as technology improves (e.g. faster, smaller, more efficient computers)?\n",
    "- The videos discussed 3 different ways to connect a to the drone via a computer; describe these 3 options. Which method have we been using so far?\n",
    "- How does the Aero Compute Board communicate with the Aero Flight Controller? \n",
    "- True or False: For manual flight control, the remote control communicates with the drone over wifi \n",
    "- Is optical flow responsible for mapping the environment? \n",
    "- Which sensor enables 3D visual mapping? \n",
    "- What is PX4 and where is it running on the drone? \n",
    "- Is the Aero Flight Controller running a Linux operating system? \n",
    "- A Velodyne lidar system uses the same sensing technology as the Intel RealSense. (True or False)\n",
    "- If I want to write a new, complex computer program for the drone, should I add it to the Aero Flight Controller firmware? \n",
    "- QGroundControl is a (blank) that runs on (blank).\n",
