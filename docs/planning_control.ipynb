It's up to you to decide and encode the most creative path for your drone. Again a long-exposure photo of the flight will be used for scoring with the most interesting aerial trace winning. Note: any flight that collides with the safety netting is disqualified, so make sure you know what your drone is going to do before it does it!\n",

How is information from different sensors fused in such a way to provide an internally consistent, reliable estimate of the complete state of the drone? This is the role of the _state estimator_. In this unit we will gain an understanding of the importance and challenges of estimating the state of a robot as well as the techniques for doing so.\n",
