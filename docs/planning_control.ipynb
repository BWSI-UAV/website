    "__Goal:__ In previous units we implemented black box localization algorithms on our drone (i.e. optical flow, ARTag identfication) so the drone has some estimate of where it is in the world, i.e. position. What about the other state variables of velocity, orientation, and angular rates? How is information from different sensors fused in such a way to provide an internally consistent, reliable estimate of the complete state of the drone? This is the role of the _state estimator_. In this unit we will gain an understanding of the importance and challenges of estimating the state of a robot as well as the techniques for doing so.\n",
