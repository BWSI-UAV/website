    "In order to collaborate within teams and across different hardware platforms (i.e. laptops, drones, etc), we will need to use some of the intermediate/advanced tools within git/GitHub, particularly [forking remote repositories](https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote/#remotes-and-forks). Our goal is to make these tools as easy to use as possible.\n",
