    "The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a central component to our drone's autonomy. ROS offers a powerful set of tools for interfacing between multiple heterogeneous computer processes, which is a common theme of robotics due to that fact that robots are often composed of a system of processors, sensors, and actuators. \n",

    "The following ETH and Erle lectures reference an older version of ROS called `indigo`. At the time of this writing we use a version called `kinetic` (and will likely be moving to a version called `melodic` in the near future). For the most part, any commands that explicitly reference `indigo` can substituted with the same command where `kinetic` is used in place of `indigo`. \n",
