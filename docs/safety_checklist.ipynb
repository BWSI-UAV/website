    "Flights are conducted in an enclosed space, either indoors or enclosed by netting outdoors, to prevent fly offs. Spectators not actively engaged in the flight test will be separated from flight area by netting, barriers, and/or 25 feet of distance. Pilots and other test participants that need to be in closer proximity to drone (e.g. need to power cycle hardware), will wear personal protective equipment for full duration of testing. Minimum PPE required: safety goggles/glasses. If handling drone during tests, gardening gloves required."
