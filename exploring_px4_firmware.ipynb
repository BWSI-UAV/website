    "# Exploring PX4 Firmware\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an advanced (and yet to be completed) tutorial on exploring and modifying the PX4 firmware. The PX4 firmware is the low-level, real-time flight control code that runs on the drone's flight control board. For this class, the flight control board is the Intel AeroFC but PX4 runs just the same on [a wide range of other autopilot boards](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/flight_controller/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The PX4 source code is all open source and under active development; see [here](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot). This means that you can go in an modify the low-level control algorithms that are responsible for keeping your drone in stable, controlled flight! This low-level access is a powerful tool for developing advanced capabilities for your drone, but also increases the complexity and potential safety hazard of operations; thus why this is considered an advanced topic.\n",

    "1. Build and flash new versions of Firmware\n",
    "2. Enable the `uORB Listener` functionality for low-level debugging\n",
    "3. Write a `Hello World` app for PX4 -->"
