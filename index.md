## Course Overview

The objective of this course is to introduce you to all of the theory, software, hardware, and practical skills necessary to design and fly an autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). This site attempts to aggregate and organize all of that content to help you learn the material as easily and quickly as possible.

In 2018, the program was offered in person. Students programmed an automonous UAV to navigate an obstacle course. You can view the demo here: [Video: Final Challenge Demo - Phantom 2018](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HsiDlrG2ZOzvFGZi6J3fCFllCGCw0ZoB)

## BWSI @ Home

In response to the COVID-19 Pandemic, the course content has been adapted to teach the same skills, but on a cost-effective, small platform. These resources are included as well to develop UAV skills for a wider audience. Please note this curriculum was developed over a short window and may not be as verbosely documented as the in-person curriculum.

In 2021, the program was offered remotely. Below are the final student presentations:
